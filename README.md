# Run Volttron Tests

A GitHub Action that sets up a Volttron test environment and runs the Volttron suite of tests. 

## Example

Below is a complete Workflows example. Note that there are two pre-steps before the run-tests-volttron Action is run:

````yaml
---
name: Testing testutils directory
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu-18.04, ubuntu-20.04 ]
        python-version: [ 3.6, 3.7 ]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python ${{matrix.os}} ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Run pytest on ${{ matrix.python-version }}, ${{ matrix.os }}
        uses: bonicim/run-tests-volttron@v1
        with:
            python_version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
            os: ${{ matrix.os }}
            test_path: 'volttrontesting/testutils'
            test_output_suffix: 'testutils'
````

## Inputs

### `test_path`
The path to a directory or file that contains Volttron-specific tests from the [Volttron repo](https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron)
